# College TimetableApp ASJ

*Problem Statement:*

As timing and time table are more important in our life to be punctual enough to do our works, saving images and searching for them is time consuming,
an application on the college timetable will be appropriate for making things in the bound of time.

*Proposed Solution :*

This project process includes two admin and user level, where admin is able to modify the data, and user is able to view the time table.
admin access will be given to teachers who can be able to modify the timetables based on the years of student.


Functionality & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students and teachers select their year of study( 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years).

Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages.
- Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of subjects and their timings we used the efficient recyclerview.
- LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the timing and the timetable received from admin level at real time and update it to local databases using Room.

*Application Link & Future Scope :*

Once the app is fully tested and functional in Methodist college of engineering and technology, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this transportation service.
